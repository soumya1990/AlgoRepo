/*
 * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
 * hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
 * The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; 
 * and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag proble
 * 
 * Example: 
 * [1,0,0,1,2,0,1]
 * 
 * Option 1: 
 * 1. Sort the array - O(lgN)
 * Option 2:
 * Use modified partition used in quick sort.
 * 
 * - Use 2 variables lt and gt 
 * - invariants - before lt all are 0
 * - after gt all are 2
 * from lt to gt all are 1
 * 
 * 1,0,2,1,2,0,1,0

 * i =0,
 * j = 6
 * lt = 0
 * gt = 0 -> 1 
* 
== 1 then gt++, i++
== 0 then lt++, gt++, exchange
