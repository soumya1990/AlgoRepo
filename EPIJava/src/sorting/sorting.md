| **Comparison-Based Sorting** |                |                   |               |                |                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bubble Sort         | O(n)           | O(n^2)              | O(n^2)          | O(1)           | Simple, but inefficient for large datasets. In-place.                                                                                                                |
| Insertion Sort      | O(n)           | O(n^2)              | O(n^2)          | O(1)           | Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data. In-place.                                                                                                       |
| Selection Sort      | O(n^2)         | O(n^2)              | O(n^2)          | O(1)           | Simple, but generally less efficient than insertion sort. In-place.                                                                                                |
| Merge Sort          | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)          | O(n log n)      | O(n)           | Stable, efficient for large datasets. Requires additional space for merging. Not in-place.                                                                           |
| Quick Sort          | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)          | O(n^2)          | O(log n) avg, O(n) worst| Very efficient in practice. In-place (with optimizations), but worst-case space can be significant. Pivot selection is critical.                                                                |
| Heap Sort           | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)          | O(n log n)      | O(1)           | Efficient, in-place, and generally performs well. Not stable.                                                                                                     |
| Shell Sort          | O(n) to O(n log n) | Varies (depends on gap sequence) | O(n(log n)^2) or worse | O(1)           | Variation of insertion sort, more efficient for medium-sized datasets. In-place, but performance highly dependent on the gap sequence used.                                    |
| Timsort             | O(n)           | O(n log n)          | O(n log n)      | O(n)           | Hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. Stable, efficient for real-world data. Used in Java's `Arrays.sort()` and Python's `sorted()`. |
| **Non-Comparison-Based Sorting** |                |                   |               |                |                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Radix Sort          | O(nk)          | O(nk)               | O(nk)           | O(n + k)         | Efficient for sorting integers or strings with fixed-length keys. Not in-place. k is the number of digits/characters in the largest number/string.                               |
| Bucket Sort         | O(n + k)       | O(n + k)            | O(n^2)          | O(n + k)         | Efficient for uniformly distributed data within a known range. Performance depends on the distribution of elements. Not in-place. k is the number of buckets. |
